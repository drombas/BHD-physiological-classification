# Physiological signal classification ([BHD 2021](https://brainhack-donostia.github.io/))

### Project goal
[Physiopy](https://github.com/physiopy/) is a python3 suite to format and analyse physiological recordings. One of our current development goals is implementing an automatic signal classifier. To do so, in this project we provide time-series data of 4 kinds of physiological signals and the goal will be to collaborate to find robust features that allow discerning between them.

### Data ([download link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3y5lhpn09qiz4my/AABKmpFuaGP_aHqxsAJ6LVwza?dl=0))
- 4 types of signals (cardiac, respiratory chest, O2 and CO2)
- 240 time-series (60x4) recordings of 500 seconds long
- 2 files: time_series.csv (time-series data) and annotations.csv (time-series labels)
